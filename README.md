# Parking_Garage_Weekend_Project

This was truly a GROUP project. 
Both Katie & Dyonne collaborated equally on this project. 
We wrote the meat & potatoes of the code together & had a working garage on Friday.
We both added to the code on Saturday.
Katie did some troubleshooting with our while loop & the takeTicket method, because our code was not accounting for spots already taken.
Dyonne did some trouble shooting with our count where our cars weren't being removed from the current tickets.
We are very satisfied with the turnout of our weekend project & enjoyed working together.
